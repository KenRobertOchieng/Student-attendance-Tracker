So my project is about Student Attendace tracker
And in this web app ...one can actually delete a student, add student and even edit a student
So in each case of adding a student, there is actually a default attendancy which is set to "LATE"
And in any instance where by you click on a wrong attendancy...you are actually notified on the write attendancy that is in the dataset
So when you go back to the dataset...that wrong attendancy that you have clicked on is actually recorded, but yu can go back to the web app and change it to the one that yu were notified on.

Thank yu.
